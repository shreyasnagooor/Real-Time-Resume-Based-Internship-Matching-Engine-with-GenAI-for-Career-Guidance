#  Real-Time Resume-Based Internship Matching Engine with Gen AI for Career Guidance
üìã Overview
The Job-Resume Matchmaking System leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to match job descriptions with candidate resumes. By analyzing the semantic content of job descriptions and resumes, the system helps match candidates with the most relevant job positions based on the similarity of their skills, experience, and qualifications. It automates the tedious process of job matching, allowing recruiters and applicants to focus on the most promising opportunities.

üåü Why This Project Matters
Finding the right fit between job descriptions and resumes is a challenging and time-consuming task for recruiters. Traditional methods of manual matching are often inefficient and prone to human error. This project addresses this problem by using semantic matching to automatically recommend the best job roles for candidates based on their resumes. It optimizes the recruitment process, reduces time-to-hire, and improves the quality of job matches, benefiting both employers and job seekers.

üöÄ Key Features
Semantic Job-Resume Matching: Matches job descriptions with resumes based on content similarity using advanced NLP techniques.
Automated Recommendations: Automatically recommends top job roles for candidates, helping them find relevant opportunities.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses job descriptions and resumes to ensure high-quality analysis.
Performance Evaluation: Measures the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure robust matching.
Visualization of Results: Provides insightful visualizations of cosine similarity scores to understand how well the job descriptions align with resumes.
üìä How It Works
Data Collection: Job descriptions and resumes are loaded from CSV files, which contain clean and structured data.
Preprocessing: Text data is cleaned and tokenized, removing stop words, special characters, and irrelevant data.
Vectorization: The SentenceTransformer model is used to convert job descriptions and resumes into numerical vectors.
Cosine Similarity Calculation: Cosine similarity is used to measure the similarity between resumes and job descriptions.
Recommendation Generation: The system identifies the top job matches for each resume based on the similarity scores.
Evaluation and Visualization: The matching results are evaluated, and a distribution of similarity scores is visualized for further insights.
üåü Impact on Society
Improved Hiring Efficiency: Reduces the time spent by recruiters in manually sifting through resumes, speeding up the recruitment process.
Better Job Matching: Increases the likelihood of finding a perfect job match, leading to greater job satisfaction for candidates.
Fairer Recruitment: Reduces bias by focusing on the content of the resumes and job descriptions, leading to a more objective selection process.
Enhanced Candidate Experience: Candidates are matched with job opportunities that best suit their skills and qualifications, improving their chances of being hired.
This project will make hiring more efficient, equitable, and tailored to the needs of both job seekers and employers.

üîÑ Sample Usage
Input:

Job Description: "Looking for a Software Engineer with experience in machine learning, data structures, and algorithms."
Resume: "Experienced software engineer skilled in machine learning algorithms and data analysis."
Output:

Top Job Matches for Resume:
Job 1: "Software Engineer - AI & Machine Learning"
Job 2: "Data Analyst with Machine Learning Expertise"
Job 3: "Junior Software Developer with Algorithms Knowledge"
Visualization:
A histogram showing the distribution of cosine similarity scores between resumes and job descriptions.

üß™ Evaluation
The model is evaluated based on the following metrics:

Precision: Measures the proportion of true positive matches out of all positive predictions.
Recall: Measures the proportion of true positive matches out of all actual positive matches.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model in correctly identifying matching job descriptions.
